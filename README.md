# MyLeetcode
This is my way to build up my code ability, and it must be!
## Add Two Numbers
this is the first problem that i solved by myself. 2333

I made a fault when I first submit it, I forgot to consider the situation 5+5, just a small problem

Time Complexity:O(n)

## Pow(x,n)

This problem made me very confused. at the very first, I used the most commen method to solve it, however I got <font color="red">TLE</font>. the datas for test are too big(where is the range of the test datas? ). And then, I used <font color="red">fast power</font> to handle this. However, failed again. ~~n could be a negative number???~~ Finally after all of the trap, I got accepted. :)

## The Longest Substring without Repeating Characters

It's so exciting that my code was accepted at the first submition. To solve this problem, I build a integer string to determin whather a character showed up before (to reduce the time complexity ). And then, use the sliding window to reduce the time complexity.

Time Complexity:O(2n)

## Palindrome Number

Thought I accepted it, I think my answer is not so perfect. because it is said that when using "Reverse Integer" might overflow, and I didn't solve this problem. So, I am confusied.

## String to Integer

This is the most disgusting problem I have met. I know that there must be some bug. but I didn't realise that the test data is so disgusting. However, the mistake I made is mainly on the boundry. And I finally know why problem 9 may have some problems.

Time Complexity:O(n)

## Container With Most Water

At the very first, I even can't understand the problem. And then, after carfully reading, I understood what kind of problem I should solve. Just find the rectangle whose area is the widest. I didn't try the most commen method, because I think it would run out of time. So, I used this kind of method <a href=https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000008824222>click me to see method</a>. without any accident, I got accept.
TimeComplexity:O(n)
